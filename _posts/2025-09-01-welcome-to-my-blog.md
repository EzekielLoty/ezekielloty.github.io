Hello world! ðŸ‘‹  

This is my first **dummy post** for testing the blog section of my Chirpy Jekyll site. Hereâ€™s a quick list of things I can include in my posts:

- Text formatting: **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`.
- Lists, both ordered and unordered:
  1. First item
  2. Second item
  - Sub-item
- Links: [Chirpy GitHub](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
- Images:

I can also write code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
