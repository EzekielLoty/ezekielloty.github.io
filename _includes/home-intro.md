Hi, I’m Ezekiel 👋

Welcome to my portfolio and blog!  

I’m a **Computer Science student** with a strong interest in **software engineering, data analytics, and problem solving**. My projects range from building efficient backend systems and REST APIs to data-driven tools like performance analytics dashboards.  

I enjoy working on **challenging problems**, learning from others, and turning ideas into impactful solutions. Currently, I’m seeking opportunities to grow my skills through a **Summer 2025 Software Engineering Co-op**.  

On this site, you’ll find:
